# Introduction to PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal)

## What is a PEP?
A **Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP)** is a design document providing information to the Python community, or describing a new feature for Python or its processes or environment.

PEPs are intended to:
- Propose new features or improvements.
- Collect community input on an issue.
- Document the design decisions made.

---

## Purpose of PEPs
- **Standardization**: Ensure Python evolves in a consistent and agreed-upon manner.
- **Transparency**: Decisions and changes are documented and available for everyone.
- **Discussion**: Provide a platform for the community to discuss proposals before implementation.

## Types of PEPs
1. **Standards Track PEPs**  
   Describe a new feature or implementation for Python.
2. **Informational PEPs**  
   Provide guidelines or information to the community without proposing a new feature.
3. **Process PEPs**  
   Describe a process surrounding Python, such as release schedules.

## PEP Workflow
1. **Idea**: Anyone can come up with an idea for improvement.
2. **Draft**: The idea is formalized into a PEP document.
3. **Discussion**: The PEP is discussed among the Python community.
4. **Acceptance/Rejection**: Python Steering Council decides on the proposal.
5. **Implementation**: If accepted, it is implemented into Python.

## Famous Examples
- **PEP 8**: Style Guide for Python Code.
- **PEP 20**: The Zen of Python.
- **PEP 484**: Type Hints.

## Additional Notes
- PEPs are stored and maintained at [https://peps.python.org/](https://peps.python.org/).
- Each PEP has a unique number, title, author(s), and status.
