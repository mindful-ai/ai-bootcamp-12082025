Difference Between git pull and git fetch

Both git pull and git fetch are commands used to update the contents of a local repository from a remote repository, but they operate differently and serve distinct purposes.

git fetch

The git fetch command communicates with the remote repository and retrieves any updates. However, it does not modify the working files in your local repository. Instead, it updates the remote tracking branches in your local repository. This means that the changes are downloaded, but not applied to your working branch. For example:

git fetch origin master
This command fetches the latest changes from the remote master branch and updates the local origin/master branch. However, your local master branch remains unchanged until you explicitly merge the changes.

git pull

The git pull command is essentially a combination of git fetch and git merge. It fetches the updates from the remote repository and then immediately merges them into your current working branch. This means that any changes from the remote branch are directly applied to your local branch. For example:

git pull origin master
This command fetches the latest changes from the remote master branch and merges them into your local master branch in one step.
